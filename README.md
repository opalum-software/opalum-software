Hi, I'm Opalum Software.
I'm Colombian.
I'm a programming student focused on web development and databases.

I'm going to use Github for the creation of my own projects and use it as a portfolio of my work to show my experience.
If you see a code that you like, take it (and if possible mention Opalum :D)
